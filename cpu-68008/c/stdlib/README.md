# stdlib
This directory contains the source to the static "standard library" that C apps on the 68komputer can make use of. It incorporates components from [Embedded Artistry's libc](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/libc) project, and incorporates [libmemory](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/libmemory) for optional dynamic memory allocation as well.

## Dependencies
- [printf](https://github.com/mpaland/printf): Used for the printf implementation, without any modifications.
