# Enhanced BASIC
This directory contains version 3.54 of Lee Davison's Enhanced Basic for 68000 modified to work with the 68komputer.

Sources were copied from [Jeff Tranter's Github repository](https://github.com/jefftranter/68000/tree/master/ehbasic) for his 68000 computer. The main ways in which this was modified was to use the `TRAP #15` method for IO, and to accept either CR or LF as a return key. Also, the assembler syntax (comments) were changed for vasm.
